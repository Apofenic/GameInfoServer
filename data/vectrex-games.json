This edition along with a boxed Vectrex console was shipped to various retail sales locations to advertise Mr. Boston products to the customer at the counter. After the game booted up in the Vectrex, and before starting game play, an screen was show to the customer stating \"MR BOSTON FINE LIQUORS: FLAVORED BRANDIES CORDIALS SCHNAPPS COCKTAILS BRANDY PRESENT\". After the advertising screen the game Clean Sweep would start. Inside the game play the main character's vacuum cleaner graphic is replaced with a top_hat similar to the one Mr. Boston's mascot wears as seen in the company's branding logo. This variation is exceedingly rare with and only 3 complete boxed known games to exist. And less than 10 total cartridges known to exist."

Notable for using the built in hardware to provide the speech unlike most other consoles of the time that needed external add-on hardware to create speech. Game speech provided during scene interludes as a recorded phrase playback. Speech playback used so much of the Vectrex resources that speech during regular game play action that it would have affected game play."
